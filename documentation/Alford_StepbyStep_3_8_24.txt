1. Added the encoding
2. Fixed the letter and chapter attribute values (were missing quotations)
    - Searched <ch n=(\d+)>
    - Replaced with <ch n="\1">
    - Searched <letter n=(\d)>
    - Replaced with <letter n="\1">
3. Went further into the text to fix chapters
    - Had to delete the <p></p> surrounding the chapter
    - Moved </ch> to the end of the chapter
    *Most of this was done manually but some used the Find/Replace function
         - Searched <ch n=(\d+)>
         - Replaced with <ch n="\1">*
!Correction:
    - I was able to adjust the Find/Replace command
        Find: <ch n=(\d+)</p>>
        Replace: <ch n="\1">
*Still had to manually correct chapters 4 through 10
*Also still manually deleted <p></p> and moved </ch>

4. Created and attached schema to mark-up
