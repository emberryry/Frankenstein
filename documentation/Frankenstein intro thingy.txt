Frankenstein is a classic novel written in 1818 started when Mary Shelly was only 18 years old. With influences from gothic novels and the romantic movement the novel has has influenced modern horror in many ways. Guillermo del Toro is one such person who has been influenced by Mary Shelly and her book calling her the most important figure from English legacy during his 2018 BAFTA best director speech, he is currently making a movie based on the book. The book evokes horror though its descriptions of the monster and the fear of what man has created. Its second name is the Modern Prometheus which is appropriate since Dr.Frankenstien can be seen as Prometheus who brought fire to humans and was punished for it. It is a very apt comparison.
