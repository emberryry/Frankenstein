        <h2>About</h2>
        <h5>This siteâ€™s purpose is to look at Frankenstein and determine how several factors show the differences in narrators and the importance of their role to the story. We did this by looking at three factors, two of which are directly connected to one another. The first factor we looked at was how many paragraphs there were per chapter and how this might relate to who the narrator for that particular chapter is at the time. Next, we looked at the speakers quoted during the entirety of the novel and their connections to a particular narrator.</h5>
        <h5>When looking at all of these factors, we found that Frankenstein was the narrator for most chapters, and he had the most paragraphs per chapter. His all time high was 51 paragraphs in chapter 7. While he did narrator chapter 24, which had a total of 82 paragraphs, he was not the only narrator for that chapter and so we can not count it as solely his. Chapter 24 was the outlier in this project. It should also be noted that Frankenstein had the most connections within the novel.</h5>
