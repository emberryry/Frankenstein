            Reasoning for Project:
            <br><br> This was a student-ran project that was directed to be made by our professor Dr. Campbell in our Data, Coding, and Visualization course at the University of Pitt-Greensburg during the 2024 spring semester.
            
          <br><br>  Purpose:
          <br><br>  This siteâ€™s purpose is to look at Frankenstein and determine how several factors show the differences in narrators and the importance of their role to the story. We did this by looking at three factors, two of which are directly connected to one another. The first factor we looked at was how many paragraphs there were per chapter and how this might relate to who the narrator for that particular chapter is at the time. Next, we looked at the speakers quoted during the entirety of the novel and their connections to a particular narrator. 
          
          <br><br> Process:
            
            <br><br> Our team decided to go with the 1883 version of the story as this is the most up to date version. The story had several changes made to it as well that may have affected how much material our team was going to work with. We decided not to use all five main versions of the text as there wouldn't have been too much variance between them that could be measured. It also would not have an impact on our research question, so we decided to focus all of our attention on one text only.
            
            <br><br> Coding Method:
            
            <br><br> Due to looking at mostly the paragraph count within chapters, as well as speakers and narrators, we started with marking up our entire xml with paragraph tags. Then we went in and marked quotes individually. This took a great amount of effort to do on Myles end as he could not use regex to just mark them all at the same time. He had to go through and mark most of them individually and make sure that actual quotes were being tagged. This then allowed Daniel to go in and mark the quotes with specific speakers. To make sure this all went well, Rin worked on the schema, they had to fix it several times to make sure all attributes and values were correct. 
            
            <br><br> Design:
            
            <br><br> In a weekly meeting, we decided to go with a green background as that is the color that most people associate with the Monster and so we thought it would be a nice touch. Myles then went a step further to add a black boarder at the top to make it look like the Monster's hair. Originally there was also two bolts by the main header on the website, but they would keep covering up text and so they ultimately had to be taken off of the site. 
            <br> As for the top bar, we decided that the site would have a cleaner look if we had a drop down menu for our graphs.
            
           <br> <br> Data:
            <br><br>When looking at all of these factors, we found that Frankenstein was the narrator for most chapters, and he had the most paragraphs per chapter. His all time high was 51 paragraphs in chapter 7. While he did narrator chapter 24, which had a total of 82 paragraphs, he was not the only narrator for that chapter and so we can not count it as solely his. Chapter 24 was the outlier in this project. It should also be noted that Frankenstein had the most connections within the novel.
        
        <br><br> Future Plans:
            
            <br><br> If we were to continue working on this project than we would have included the letters in with what we looked at. We also could look at the other versions of the text and see if there is any significant changes in paragraph counts, or connections. Another thing that we would add is a map of all the locations that the story goes through and create a hoverable text box over each area of the map that tells which chapters took place within that area.
