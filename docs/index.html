        <h6>Mary Shelley is renowned for her novel Frankenstein, also known as The Modern Prometheus. The idea of this novel came to her when she participated in a fun competition to write the best ghost story in 1816. It would then be published two years later, though her name would not be put on the cover until 1823. Frankenstein was inspired by other Gothic novels and the Romantic movement. The novel also has five significant versions, but for the purpose of this website we looked at the 1831 version of the novel. <br><br>The 1831 version brought in a new shift for the novel as Shelley had become a widow and lost her second child. This shift focused on Victor and his mistake for abandoning the life he created, rather than the mistake of creating life in the first place (Hadi, 2018).</h6>
